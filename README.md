# rent_calculator
A simple python program to calculate rent with increases at certain times from the initial rent. It takes a value of a starting rent, few increases with time stamps and shows a total rent spent over the years.



This "calculator" takes users input for his initial rent, asks about a rent difference when an increase has happened as well as a date of it happening.
It takes two increases so far, shows rent for each month, shows which month the increase affected as well as showing total rent spent in that month.

I might tweak it later on to take user input for when to start calculating from as well as more customizable rent increases, like asking if the rent has
increased again or not, instead of two increases without having an option for less or more times of it happening. 

Could potentionally make a conversion to other curencies as well.

Maybe I'll come up with something more too.
